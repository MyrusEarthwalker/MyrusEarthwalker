    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
      I'm Myrus, a self-taught IT professional based in Denver, CO with a passion for cybersecurity, Linux, and hardware diagnostics. My experience ranges from hands-on technical support and system administration to hardware customization.

      I value problem-solving, deep learning, and working on real-world challenges that require adaptability and precision. Whether it’s streamlining workflows, building systems from scratch, or reverse-engineering solutions—I love getting into the details and pushing the limits of my understanding.
